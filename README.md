# Mario


Mario game written using __C programming__, with the help of a library called __'Allegro'__.

The project has been developed in Visual Studio 2010 environment.

So, the [.sln file](https://github.com/arjun2000ashok/Mario/blob/master/mario.sln) can be directly opened in Visual Studio 2010, or the files in mario can be opened in any IDE after installing the libraries.

The Allegro libraries should be installed in the computer for which one can follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ2krJ8Ls2A) tutorial, and the libraries can be downloaded from [this](https://www.allegro.cc/files/) link.

The main file associated with the project is the [main.cpp file inside the mario folder](https://github.com/arjun2000ashok/Mario/blob/master/mario/main.cpp).
